## Register Number:212224040362
## Name:Vinuthaa NN
## Problem Title
smart cities and urban developement
## Problem Description
Smart cities focus on leveraging technology to enhance urban living by improving infrastructure, reducing pollution, managing resources efficiently, and ensuring safety.Traffic congestion is a major problem in Indian cities, leading to longer travel times, pollution, and accidents. Traditional traffic lights work on fixed timers without adapting to real-time traffic flow.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment
